<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>
Java is an attractive programming language due to its many features,
including automatic memory management, lack of pointer arithmetic,
and its support of concurrency, all of which help make it an arguably
better language than C or C++, on which Java is loosely based.
While Java's concurrency features, in the form of its threads
package, are powerful, they can also be easily misused. Uneducated
use of Java's threading features may lead to non-determinate programs,
which arises from arbitrary ordering of interacting events in
separate threads. Non-determinism may be eliminated by imposing
an order on all such interacting events.
<p>
Java's synchronization primitives are sufficient to achieve a
wide range of thread interaction behavior, but not well-suited
in their raw form for use in imposing ordering on events in different
threads. Approaches to this problem that directly use the synchronization
primitives likely will be erroneous or inefficient if implemented
by novices in concurrent programming. One solution to this problem
is to provide higher level synchronization abstractions for the
users.
<p>
Rendezvous, a mechanism for imposing an ordering on events in
an arbitrary number of concurrent threads, was developed for Java.
The rendezvous is shown to be useful in synchronous applications,
where ordering of certain events between threads is necessary
to ensure determinism. Relative to a comparable implementation
using one of the standard Java synchronization methods, rendezvous
is easier to use and gives better program performance.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems, released to the public in May 1995. It was intended
originally for use in embedded consumer applications, but has
found the greatest amount of success as a language for networked
applications. Although Java is very similar in syntax to C and
C++, it contains many features lacking in these languages which
make Java significantly different. The most important of these
features are automatic memory management, lack of pointer arithmetic,
and standardized support of concurrency. In this paper we address
some issues raised by the last feature, concurrency.
<p>
Java's support for concurrency is in the form of its standard
threads library. It gives the user the ability to easily fork
new threads, join with other threads, as well as to stop or suspend
them. In addition, Java has a built-in thread synchronization
mechanism based on monitors. While the primitives provided are
very powerful, in that they may used to implement a wide range
of behaviors, they can also be easily misused and lead to incorrect,
non-determinate programs.
<p>
Thus, it is critical that the threads package in Java be used
intelligently and carefully. However, it is unreasonable to expect
all Java programmers to be experts in concurrent programming.
Perhaps this will become a reality in the future, but with the
current generation of programmers trained in C and C++, other
solutions should be found to encourage safe use of Java threads.
<p>
The approach espoused in this paper is that of layering abstractions
onto Java threads to create &quot;higher&quot; order concurrency
mechanisms that can be used with lesser chance of error. In particular,
we demonstrate how a seemingly simple use of Java's synchronization
primitives can lead to non-determinacy and erroneous programs.
We then show how a rendezvous mechanism can be of great general utility,
decrease the likelihood of programming errors, and how it can
increase program performance.
<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>
In single-threaded applications, program correctness is usually
independent of the timing of its execution, and determined solely
by the logical correctness of its functions. However, in multithreaded
applications it is often the case that execution timing may have
a great affect on the correctness of the program. Given one set
of inputs, many different outputs might be produced, depending
on how the threads are interleaved by the scheduler. Such programs
with multiple possible behaviors are called <i>non-determinate</i>,
and are in general undesirable<sup>*</sup>. Non-determinate programs
can also be difficult to debug, as the offending behaviors may
not be readily reproducible, and the use of a debugger may in
fact modify its behavior.

dictated by Java threads.</b></a></center>
<p>
To address the issue of non-determinacy in a multithreaded Java
program, we must first establish a framework in which to discuss
the environment created by the Java language. To begin, we take
the semantics of a Java program to be simply a <i>partial order</i>
on <i>events</i>. <i>Events</i> are the instructions that must
be executed in order to carry out the functionality dictated by
the text of the program. One can take the events to be the sequence
of bytecodes executed on the Java virtual machine, but this detail
is not critical to our discussion. The events in the program are
initially totally ordered with respect to one another, until a
call to the <tt>Thread.start()</tt> method is executed. At this
point, the subsequent events in the initial thread are not ordered
relative to the events dictated by the <tt>run()</tt> method of
the new thread which was just started. This relation is shown
graphically in Figure 1. In addition, we consider the program's
<i>state</i> to be defined by the contents of all of its variables,
and the &quot;program counter,&quot; which keeps track of the
next event to be executed within each thread.
<p>
In comparison with other concurrent languages, Java can be characterized
as an asynchronous language. Thus, it is similar to languages
such as Ada, Occam, and CSP [<a NAME="_Ref374789187">1], and quite
different from synchronous languages, such as Esterel, Argos,
and Lustre. In asynchronous languages an arbitrary amount of time
may pass while one concurrent process (i.e., thread) waits to
communicate with another, while in synchronous languages communications
are thought of as &quot;instantaneous&quot; [2]. In practice,
this means that the concurrent processes in asynchronous languages
operate somewhat independently from one another, while in synchronous
languages the processes operate together in lockstep. Practically,
a fundamental difference between them is that asynchronous languages
support non-determinism, while synchronous languages do not.</a>
<p>
Non-determinism in Java arises fundamentally from unspecified
ordering of interdependent events in concurrent threads. For example,
in Figure 2, a path of communication between two threads exists
through a shared variable <tt>x</tt>. Thread 0 reads the value
from <tt>x</tt>, while thread 1 writes a value to <tt>x</tt>.
However, unless measures are taken to fix the order in which these
threads access <tt>x</tt>, the resulting program might be non-determinate.
Sometimes thread 0 might read <tt>x</tt> before thread 1 writes
<tt>x</tt>, other times thread 1 will write <tt>x</tt> before
thread 0 reads <tt>x.</tt> Both behaviors are acceptable interpretations
of the Java program. Unless the program has been designed to take
both these two possible orderings into account, the resulting
program behavior will be non-determinate. Therefore, to eliminate
non-determinacy, one must identify all possible inter-thread interactions,
and impose an ordering on all pairs of interacting events.

from unspecified ordering of events.</b></a></center>
<p>
We first investigate the synchronization primitives provided by
Java, and how they may be used to impose ordering constraints
between events in separate threads. Then a rendezvous mechanism
for Java is introduced, and is shown to be easier to use, more
scaleable, and faster than other techniques.
<h3>JAVA'S SYNCHRONIZATION PRIMITIVES</h3>
<p>
In order to allow the programmer to impose ordering on events
between threads if so desired, Java provides a synchronization
mechanism based on monitors. The features are invoked through
the keyword <tt>synchronized</tt>, and the methods <tt>wait()</tt>,
<tt>notify()</tt>, and <tt>notifyAll()</tt>.
<p>
Each object in Java has a lock and a monitor to manage the lock.
By naming one of the object's methods <tt>synchronized</tt>, this
forces any thread wishing to invoke this method to acquire the
lock for this object first. The lock is released by the thread
once it returns from the method. Note that a thread can hold locks
to many objects at once. The thread will block until it can get
the lock if another thread already holds the lock to that object.
In short, <tt>synchronized</tt> is useful to ensure mutual exclusion
of groups of events. For example, Figure 3 shows two threads that
both execute calls to synchronized methods in object A. While
thread 1 executes <tt>foo()</tt>, thread 0 reaches a point where
it wishes to call <tt>bar()</tt>. However, since both <tt>foo()</tt>
and <tt>bar()</tt> are declared synchronized, thread 0 must block
until thread 1 has exited from <tt>foo()</tt>. Subsequently, if
thread 1 wishes to call method <tt>fooBar()</tt>, it must wait
until thread 0 has exited from <tt>bar()</tt>. One important thing
to note is that synchronized does not impose ordering constraints.
In the example, another equally likely scenario is for thread
1 to execute both <tt>foo()</tt> <tt>and</tt> <tt>fooBar()</tt>,
before thread 0 reaches <tt>bar()</tt>. Therefore, another mechanism
is required to impose ordering between events in separate threads.
<p>

<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374738653"><b>Figure 3. Synchronized ensures
mutual exclusion of sequences of events.</b></a></center>
<p>
Ordering on events in separate threads is imposed by the use of
the <tt>wait()</tt>, <tt>notify()</tt>, and <tt>notifyAll()</tt>
methods. While the thread has the lock of an object, it may call
the object's <tt>wait()</tt> method. This atomically suspends
the thread and releases the lock. The thread is added to the object's
&quot;wait set&quot; [3], which contains a list of the threads
waiting on the object. Subsequently, when another thread acquires
that object's lock, that thread may elect to call either the <tt>notify()</tt>
or <tt>notifyAll()</tt> methods. A call to <tt>notify()</tt> will
choose one thread from the wait set in an unspecified manner (i.e.,
the wait set is not necessarily a FIFO), and resume its execution.
A call to <tt>notifyAll()</tt> on the other hand resumes all the
threads in the wait set. Thus, events which occur after a call
to <tt>wait()</tt> in one thread must all happen after the call
to the corresponding <tt>notify()</tt> or <tt>notifyAll()</tt>
in another thread. This allows ordering constraints to be placed
on events in separate threads.
<p>
<center><img SRC="img00004.gif" WIDTH="619" HEIGHT="168"></center>
<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374769135"><b>Figure 4. Naïve use of
wait(), notify().</b></a></center>
<p>
Although the behaviors of <tt>wait()</tt>, <tt>notify()</tt>,
and <tt>notifyAll()</tt> are quite simple, using them correctly
requires the programmer to be aware of some subtleties. Naïve
use of these synchronization primitives can often result in non-deterministic
programs. To illustrate an example of such a pitfall, consider
the example shown in Figure 4. 
<p>
Assume that in order to ensure determinacy, it is required that
event A precede event B, and C precede D. To achieve this effect,
the programmer synchronizes the threads on a common object. To
ensure event B occurs after event A, a wait() is placed before
A, and notify() placed after A. Therefore, as long as this same
object is not used by other threads in the program for synchronization
or at other times in threads 0 and 1, event B must occur after
A. The same technique is then applied to order C and D. However,
this implementation does not always achieve the desired result.
<p>
Figure 5 shows an example of how this implementation is non-deterministic
and faulty. Assume that the first <tt>wait()</tt>/<tt>notify()</tt>
pair has executed as desired, successfully ordering A and B. However,
if thread 1 subsequently executes the call to <tt>notify()</tt>
before thread 0 calls <tt>wait()</tt>, the <tt>notify()</tt> is
&quot;lost,&quot; and thread 0 will block forever, which was not
the desired effect. Thus, ordering of events between threads is
not accomplished by simple use of <tt>wait()</tt>, <tt>notify()</tt>,
and <tt>notifyAll()</tt>.

<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374781669"><b>Figure 5. Sequence of events
leading to deadlock.</b></a></center>
<p>
One possible solution is to enclose each call to <tt>notify()
</tt>within a loop, and implement some type of handshaking protocol
between the threads when the <tt>notify()</tt> is received by
the <tt>wait()</tt>. However, this style of implementation is
quite suboptimal from several perspectives. First, an arbitrary
number of <tt>notify()</tt> calls might be made before a response
is received, thus expending extra system resources on synchronization
overhead. Second, this protocol does not easily extend to an arbitrary
number of threads. Finally, it is burdensome to the programmer
to implement by hand each time a synchronization is needed.
<p>
<center><img SRC="img00006.gif" WIDTH="678" HEIGHT="221"></center>
<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374785145"><b>Figure 6. Synchronization using
new Thread(), join().</b></a></center>
<p>
The one standard method in Java which does impose ordering constraints
in Java is <tt>Thread.join()</tt>. If one thread calls the <tt>join()</tt>
method of a second thread, it ensures that all the events of the
callee thread have been executed before the events following the
<tt>join() </tt>call in the caller thread. To achieve the clock-type
behavior we desired above, one would replace the <tt>wait()</tt>,
<tt>notify()</tt> pairs with <tt>new Thread()</tt>, <tt>join()</tt>
pairs. Each clock &quot;tick&quot; would correspond to a <tt>new
Thread()</tt>, <tt>join()</tt> pair, as shown in Figure 6. This
approach incurs the costly penalty of creating a new thread object
at every clock tick, and on most Java runtime implementations,
additional operating system overhead in starting new threads.
<p>
Hence, this approach is only practical for very large-grained
concurrency, where concurrent threads have very few interdependencies.
If finer grained concurrency is desired, where interactions between
threads are rich are relatively common and opportunities for non-deterministic
behavior are more frequent, the extra overhead incurred by using
<tt>join()</tt> is unacceptable. This approach also is quite inelegant
from a programming perspective, as events which are part of one
logical thread are segregated into separate thread objects.
<p>
Java's synchronization primitives are inherently best at describing
asynchronous communications between threads, where some amount
of non-determinacy is expected and in fact desired. Examples of
applications for which the primitives are well-suited include
user interfaces, multimedia, and other interactive systems, where
an occasional lost button click or dropped video frame is not
detrimental to the system's overall correctness. However, to achieve
the functionality required by synchronous<sup>*</sup> applications,
where non-determinacy must be in general be avoided, abstractions
designed specifically for synchronous applications are needed.
<h3>A RENDEZVOUS MECHANISM FOR JAVA</h3>
<p>
It is clear that a more efficient and easier mechanism is needed
in Java to impose ordering on events in different threads. Without
such a mechanism, only experts in Java and concurrent programming
would be able to write non-deterministic, reliable multithreaded
programs. To this end, a mechanism based on rendezvous [1] is
written to help simplify multiprogramming tasks . The resulting
implementation provides an abstraction that is powerful, easy
to use, and efficient.
<p>
The rendezvous mechanism is implemented as a single class, and
provides a set of functions useful for a wide range of applications.
In short, it allows one to synchronize an arbitrary number of
concurrent threads very easily. To use the rendezvous class, the
methods used are <tt>add()</tt>, <tt>remove()</tt>, and <tt>rendezvous()</tt>.
First, a new rendezvous object and the new thread objects to be
synchronized are created. Then, the threads are placed in the
rendezvous, using the <tt>add()</tt> method, usually before the
new threads are started. Within the body of each thread, the <tt>rendezvous()</tt>
method of the rendezvous object is called. This causes that thread
to block until all threads in that particular rendezvous have
called <tt>rendezvous()</tt>. When all threads reach their rendezvous
points, all the threads in the rendezvous resume execution. The
effect of the rendezvous mechanism is shown in Figure 7.
<p>
<center><img SRC="img00007.gif" WIDTH="335" HEIGHT="194"></center>
<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374787313"><b>Figure 7. Effect of rendezvous
mechanism</b></a></center>
<p>
Additionally, at any point during its execution, a thread may
elect to remove itself or another thread from the rendezvous.
This feature supports the capability to implement conditional
synchronization, which can be useful in many applications. Also,
several rendezvous objects may exist within a program at once,
and a single thread may participate in many rendezvous. This allows
many different &quot;clocks&quot; to coexist within the program,
and is also quite powerful in allowing a wide range of expression
of behaviors. Taken together, the capabilities of the rendezvous
class make it ideal for use in applications where inter-thread
interaction is rich and complex, and where determinate behavior
is desired.
<p>
The implementation of the rendezvous mechanism necessarily relies
on the primitives provided by Java, but uses them very efficiently.
The <tt>notifyAll()</tt> method is called only once per rendezvous
&quot;tick&quot;, and the <tt>wait()</tt> method is invoked once
per tick per thread. As compared to the handshaking implementation,
rendezvous does not make extraneous calls to <tt>notify()</tt>
or <tt>notifyAll()</tt>. Compared to the <tt>new Thread()</tt>,
<tt>join()</tt> approach, rendezvous does not incur the object
creation and operating system overhead. It can also be argued
that the programs using rendezvous are much cleaner and elegant
than programs using the other two approaches.
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</h3>
<p>
<center><img SRC="img00008.gif" WIDTH="528" HEIGHT="361"></center>
<p>
<center><a NAME="_Ref374788808"><b>Figure 8. Time per new Thread(),
join() pair vs. time per rendezvous &quot;tick&quot;.</b></a></center>
<p>
Performance measurements were taken comparing the <tt>new Thread()</tt>,
<tt>join()</tt> approach with the rendezvous mechanism. Experiments
were not performed comparing rendezvous to a handshaking protocol,
as the latter is not easily scaleable to an arbitrary number of
threads.
<p>
The platforms tested were a 75 MHz Sun Sparc20, running jdk (Java
Development Kit) 1.0.2; a 266 MHz DEC Alpha 21164 running jdk
1.0.2; a 133 MHz Pentium and 120 MHz Cyrix P150 running Win95,
jdk 1.0.2, Symantec's jdk 1.0.2c and Café Just-In-Time
compiler 2.00b16.
<p>
In almost all cases tested, the rendezvous implementation is faster
than using <tt>new Thread()</tt>, <tt>join()</tt>, by a factor
of from two to eight times faster. These results are graphed in
Figure 8. The only exception was with Win95, running Sun's jdk
1.0.2, as shown in Figure 9. In these cases, the rendezvous implementation
is much slower. Judging by the results obtained from the other
configurations, this suggests that this is an anomaly resulting
from a faulty implementation of <tt>notifyAll()</tt>
in the x86 version of jdk 1.0.2.

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>
One of the most attractive features of Java, its built-in threads
capabilities, is also one of its most dangerous. If not used intelligently,
it is quite simple to create non-deterministic programs that are
exceptionally difficult to debug. The source of non-determinism
in a Java program lies in the arbitrary order of execution of
events in different threads which may affect one another. To eliminate
non-determinism, one must identify all events in a thread that
may affect the behavior of events in other threads, and impose
an ordering on these events.
<p>
It was shown that while Java provides primitives for synchronization,
they are not appropriate for use as is to impose such orderings
on events. A rendezvous mechanism was implemented for the Java
language which is powerful, easy to use, and efficient. Experiments
were run comparing the rendezvous to a comparable implementation
using standard Java library calls, and it was found that rendezvous
is superior in virtually all cases.
<p>
In summary, a rendezvous mechanism in Java was found to be quite
valuable for use in a wide variety of applications, where it is
necessary to synchronize events in multiple threads to ensure
determinacy.

Additional data was obtained from the experimental measurements,

useful for providing further background on the test environments,
and the current state of Java technology. Figure 10 shows the
